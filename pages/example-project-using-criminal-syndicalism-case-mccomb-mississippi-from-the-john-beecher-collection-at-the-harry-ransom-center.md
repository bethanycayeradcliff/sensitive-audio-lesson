This project is part of an AudiAnnotate lesson plan that uses the audio recording ["'Criminal Syndicalism' case, McComb, Mississippi,"](https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll1/id/37/rec/1) from the Harry Ransom Center's [John Beecher Sound Recordings Collection](https://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p15878coll1). This project page exists as a sample project to facilitate understanding of what a collaborative classroom project could look like. 

In this example, layer titles represent annotation categories. Annotation categories are groups of annotations that relate to particular characteristics of the audio recording. These categories are reflected in the layer title. For example, the layer with the layer tite "Environment_Kylie" includes annotations in the "Environment" category (described below). The use of an underscore keeps the layer titles sortable. Adding a name to the layer indicates who created the annotations.

> **_Classrooom Suggestion:_**
 In the lesson, students will work collaboratively to select categories for annotation, and will each contribute annotations in their group work. In this example, we chose to annotate in the following categories: 
 - Environment: Environmental sounds, which could be any noise in the recording (e.g., cars horn, footsteps, noise from the recording device)
 - External References: References to other events/people (e.g., rally, bombing)
 - Speakers: Named and unnamed speakers
 - Transcription: Selected sentences transcribed from the audio recording
 - Topics: Thematic tags or phrases based on the conversations and events in the recording

***Content Warning:*** **In this recording, a racial slur is used at 16:06 by a student quoting the language said to them by a police officer while in jail. There is also explicit language used at 15:49, 16:30, and 16:39 by students quoting white police officers. Racial slurs are time-stamped below, in the layer titled "Content_Warning."**
